# Rust Introduction

**rustc** is compiler for rust, like g++ or clang for C++.

**cargo** is like npm for node.js, a pakage manager and build system.

**variables** in Rust are immutable by default. To make
a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name:

``` rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```
