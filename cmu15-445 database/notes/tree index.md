## B+ TREE OVERVIEW

### B-TREE FAMILY

People use the term to generally refer to a class of balanced tree data structures.

### B+ TREE

#### NODES

#### B-TREE VS. B+TREE

The B-tree is more space efficient since each key only appears once in the tree. 

A B+ tree only stores values in leaf nodes. Inner nodes only guide the search process.(And the inner nodes of a B+ tree can have key that does not exist in physical disk. For example, inserting and then deleting a key may come to the case)
